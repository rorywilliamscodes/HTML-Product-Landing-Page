# HTML-Product-Landing-Page
This is a Product Landing Page Template using HTML, Javascript, and CSS
HTML Description:
The HTML code represents a product landing page. It consists of various sections and elements that are structured to provide information about the product and allow user interaction. The header section contains a logo image and a navigation bar for easy navigation throughout the page. Different sections are included to showcase the product features, a video demonstration, and a form for users to enter their email address and submit it. The HTML code is semantically organized and incorporates IDs and classes for styling and JavaScript functionality.

CSS Description:
The CSS code defines the styles and layout for the product landing page. It sets the font family, margins, and paddings for the entire page. The header is styled to have a fixed position at the top of the viewport with a dark background color. The navigation bar is horizontally centered with spacing between the links. The sections have padding and are centered on the page. The video container is styled to have a centered video with a fixed width. The form is aligned to the center with appropriate styling for the input fields and submit button. Media queries are used to adjust the styles for smaller screens, ensuring a responsive layout.

JavaScript Description:
The JavaScript code adds interactivity and functionality to the product landing page. It includes smooth scrolling functionality when a navigation link is clicked, ensuring that the user is smoothly scrolled to the corresponding section on the page. It also adds HTML5 validation to the email input field, checking for a valid email address format and displaying appropriate error messages. Additionally, when the submit button is clicked, the JavaScript code can be extended to handle the submission of the email address to a specified URL for further processing. The JavaScript code enhances the user experience and improves the functionality of the landing page.
